## General Questions

### What is Apollo Care?

Apollo Care is a community-owned, blockchain-based health coverage platform built on Solana. It uses AI-driven automation to eliminate administrative waste, achieving a healthcare coverage solution where over 90% of what you pay goes directly to healthcare.

### How is Apollo Care different from traditional insurance?

| Traditional Insurance | Apollo Care |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Shareholders profit from denying claims | No shareholders—member-owned |
| 80-85% of premiums to care | 90%+ of premiums to care |
| Opaque decisions | All transactions on-chain |
| Weeks for claims | Minutes for routine claims |
| You vs. the company | Aligned incentives |

### Is Apollo Care insurance?

In **Phase 1**, Apollo operates as a Healthcare Sharing Ministry (HCSM), which is **not insurance**. Members voluntarily share medical expenses. In **Phases 2 and 3**, Apollo transitions to licensed insurance operations.

### Why blockchain?

Blockchain provides:
- **Transparency**: All reserves and transactions visible on-chain
- **Efficiency**: Automated processing reduces overhead
- **Governance**: Democratic control via token voting
- **Trust**: Code executes rules consistently, without bias

## Coverage & Membership

### Do I need to own APH tokens to get health coverage?

**No.** Health coverage is purchased through monthly USDC premium payments. Token ownership is completely optional and only provides governance rights and staking opportunities.

### How do I enroll?

1. Visit apollocare.io
2. Complete the enrollment application
3. Pay your first month's premium in USDC
4. Coverage begins after any applicable waiting period

### What does Apollo Care cover?

Coverage includes:
- Primary care and preventive services
- Specialist consultations
- Hospitalization and surgery
- Prescription medications
- Emergency care
- Mental health services
- Diagnostic testing and labs

### Can I use any doctor?

Yes. Apollo is **provider-agnostic**—you can see any licensed healthcare provider. There are no "in-network" restrictions.

### How much does coverage cost?

Premiums vary by:
- **Age** (3:1 ratio, CMS-compliant)
- **Tobacco status** (up to 1.5x maximum surcharge)
- **Geographic region**
- **Plan tier** selected

A 25-year-old might pay ~$300-400/month; a 60-year-old might pay ~$900-1,200/month for similar coverage.

### What about pre-existing conditions?

- **Phase 1 (HCSM)**: May have waiting periods for pre-existing conditions
- **Phases 2-3 (Licensed)**: No exclusions for pre-existing conditions (ACA-compliant)

## Token & Governance

### What is the APH token for?

APH provides:
1. **Governance**: Vote on platform decisions
2. **Staking**: Earn yields by backing the insurance pool
3. **Participation**: Access to community programs and incentives

### Do token holders profit from denying claims?

**No.** Apollo's design creates aligned incentives:
- Token value depends on a healthy, growing member base
- Denying legitimate claims drives members away
- Long-term success requires fair claims processing

### How does governance work?

1. **Anyone** with sufficient APH can submit proposals
2. **Community discusses** for 7 days
3. **Token holders vote** for 3 days
4. **Passed proposals** execute automatically via smart contract

### What can the DAO decide?

- Coverage policies and exclusions
- Premium rate adjustments
- Surplus allocation (buybacks, dividends)
- Committee elections
- Protocol upgrades
- Phase transitions

### How do I participate in governance?

1. Acquire APH tokens
2. Connect your wallet to the governance interface
3. Vote on active proposals
4. (Optional) Submit your own proposals

## Claims & Processing

### How do I file a claim?

1. Receive medical care
2. Submit claim via Apollo app/website
3. Upload documentation (bills, records)
4. Track status in real-time

### How fast are claims paid?

| AI-reviewed ($500-$5,000) | Hours to 24 hours |
| Committee review (>$5,000) | 1-7 days |

### What if my claim is denied?

You can:
1. **Request reconsideration** with additional documentation
2. **Appeal to Claims Committee** for human review
3. **Escalate to DAO** for community vote on exceptional cases

### How does Apollo prevent fraud?

- **AI screening** detects anomalies in real-time
- **Price validation** against UCR databases
- **Pattern analysis** identifies suspicious behavior
- **Committee review** for flagged claims
- **On-chain audit trail** for accountability
